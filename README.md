## 🧠 About the Project
Wujud was developed as a graduation project in collaboration with my team. It aims to replicate the experience of attending real-world events through a mobile-friendly, 3D interactive interface (developed in Unity, not included in this repo).

## 📌 Note
This repo contains **only** the Swift-based iOS code. Other components such as the 3D Unity environment were handled separately.
